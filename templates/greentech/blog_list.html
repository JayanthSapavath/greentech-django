                    <h4 class="card-title">Smart Textiles: The Future of Clothing</h4>
                    <p class="card-text">Smart textiles are one of the most exciting developments in fashion technology. These materials are designed to provide enhanced functionality, comfort, and even health monitoring. In Georgia, several startups are experimenting with fabrics that can change color, monitor body temperature, or even charge your devices.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">The integration of smart textiles is revolutionizing athletic wear and everyday clothing alike. Imagine a shirt that can track your heart rate during workouts or a jacket that adjusts its temperature according to the weather. Such innovations are gradually becoming a reality in Georgia's fashion landscape.</p>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">Virtual Fitting Rooms: A New Shopping Experience</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Another significant trend gaining traction in Georgia is the use of virtual fitting rooms. These high-tech solutions allow customers to try on clothes virtually using augmented reality (AR). This technology not only enhances the shopping experience but also reduces the number of returns by helping consumers find the perfect fit from the comfort of their homes.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Several retailers in Georgia are adopting these systems to offer a more personalized and engaging shopping journey. By integrating AR with their online platforms, they provide an immersive experience that bridges the gap between digital and physical shopping.</p>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">Sustainability Through Tech</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">As sustainability becomes a crucial concern in the fashion industry, technology offers viable solutions to reduce environmental impact. In Georgia, tech-driven approaches are being employed to create eco-friendly fabrics, optimize supply chains, and promote circular fashion models.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">For instance, 3D printing is being used to minimize waste in garment production, while blockchain technology ensures transparency and traceability in sourcing materials. These innovations are helping Georgia's fashion industry move towards a more sustainable future.</p>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">The Role of AI in Fashion Design</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is another powerful tool shaping fashion tech in Georgia. From predicting trends to automating design processes, AI is transforming how designers conceptualize and create fashion collections. By analyzing consumer data, AI can forecast trends with remarkable accuracy, allowing designers to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Moreover, AI-driven design tools enable creators to experiment with limitless possibilities, fostering creativity and innovation. This blend of art and technology is paving the way for a new era of fashion design in Georgia.</p>
